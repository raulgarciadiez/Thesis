\chapter{Continuous contrast variation applied to relevant bio-materials}
\label{chap:bio_applications}

In the continuously growing world of nanotechnology, nanoscience provides understanding for biological structures at the nanometre length scale, such as lipoprotein biology, while the application of nanoparticles in medicine opens exciting new possibilities in this field \citep{nie_nanotechnology_2007, sahoo_nanotech_2003, wickline_nanotechnology_2003, zhou_nano-enabled_2014, rosen_rise_2005}. For example, polymeric colloids and other biodegradable nanocarriers are finding many medical applications \citep{vicent_polymer_2006} and are starting to undergo clinical trials \citep{patel_polymeric_2012,beija_colloidal_2012,cabral_progress_2014}. 

In this sense, lipid vesicles, or liposomes, have an increasing importance in the emerging field of nanomedicine, due to their capacity to encapsulate hydrophilic compounds within the closed phospholipid bilayer membrane. In fact, liposomal nanocarriers are nowadays a widespread instrument for drug delivery \citep{perez-herrero_advanced_2015}, like the liposomal formulation of doxorubicin coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG): Caelyx\textregistered\ \citep{barenholz_doxil-first_2012}.

Despite SAXS being a usual method of choice for the accurate characterization of nanomaterials, the interpretation of the scattering curves, i.e. the model fitting, is frequently intricate for complex samples. Liposomal drugs or loaded polymeric nanoparticles belong to this class, as both the carrier and the incorporated biotarget contribute to the scattering intensity. These heterogenous samples require either \emph{a priori} knowledge about their morphology or the measurement of complementary scattering curves obtained under different experimental conditions, like in solvent contrast variation in SAXS 

In this chapter, the utilization of continuous contrast variation in SAXS is examined for the nano-drug Caelyx and for typical nanocarriers like lipid vesicles or polymeric colloids. In the latter case, the particle is coated with an antibody to resemble the biological conditions found upon injection in the bloodstream. Other components of the blood plasma like lipoproteins are also investigated with this technique. \textcolor{red}{Parts of this chapter have been adapted from articles published previously \citep{minelli_characterization_2014,garcia-diez_size_2016}.}


\section{Materials}

In this chapter, the continuous contrast variation method in SAXS presented in chapters~\ref{chap:density_gradient_SAXS} and \ref{chap:simultaneous_size_density} has been employed in a variety of samples related with nanomedicine. In this section, the different samples characterized with this technique are described and the more relevant aspects of the experiments are detailed. 

The results obtained on the Caelyx nano-drug are described in detail in section \ref{sec:caelyx_size} and \ref{sec:OsmoticCaelyx}, while the empty liposomes are investigated under osmotic pressure in section \ref{sec:liposome_osmotic}. The size measurements on the lipoproteins are presented in section \ref{sec:lipoprotein_continuous} and the use of the protein-coated nanoparticles is detailed in section \ref{sec:CoatedKiskerExperimental}.

\subsubsection{Caelyx: PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin}
\label{sec:materials_caelyx}
Caelyx\textregistered\ (SP Europe, Brussels, Belgium), was purchased from Hungaropharma Ltd and consists of liposomes suspended in 10 mM histidine buffered sucrose solution (pH 6.5) formed by fully hydrogenated soy phosphatydilcholine (HSPC), cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG 2000 (N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine). The latter yields a steric barrier at the liposomal surface due to the PEG 2000 residues that extend the blood-circulation time, the so-called \emph{stealth} function. Doxorubicin is encapsulated in the PEGylated liposome via an active loading procedure, which results in a crystal-like doxorubicin precipitate inside the liposomes, as observed in the micrograph \ref{fig:CaelyxCryoTEM} \citep{barenholz_doxil-first_2012}. A schematic depiction of the sample morphology is shown in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxScheme}.

%\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Lipid vesicles: PEGylated and plain liposomes}
\label{sec:materials_liposome}

The PEGylated liposomes were prepared \textcolor{red}{by the Institute of Materials and Environmental Chemistry (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary)} with the same lipid composition as the commercially available Caelyx for comparison purposes: the weight ratios of HSPC:DSPE-PEG 2000:cholesterol were 3:1:1 (corresponding to molar ratios of 0.565:0.053:0.382). The samples were extruded through polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore, Whatman Inc., Little Chalfont, UK) of five different pore sizes, from 50 to 400 nm. A more detailed description of the preparation is found elsewhere \citep{varga_osmotic_2014}. The components of the plain liposomes are HSPC:cholesterol with a weight ratio of 3:1 (corresponding to molar ratios of 0.6:0.4). The preparation is identical to the PEGylated liposomes. All the liposome samples are suspended in a 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 buffer solution.

\subsubsection{Human lipoproteins}

Native lipoproteins from human plasma were purchased from Merck Milipore (Darmstadt, Germany) and suspended in 150 mM NaCl, 0.01 $\%$ EDTA buffer with pH 7.4. The High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) has a protein concentration of 14.3 g L$^{-1}$, while the Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) has a protein concentration of 5.96 g L$^{-1}$, considering that the weight ratio between lipids and proteins is approximately 4:1 in the LDL sample.

%		\label{fig:HDLCoreShellFit}
%\end{figure}

%In figure \ref{fig:HDLCoreShellFit}, a single-contrast SAXS curve of HDL in buffer is displayed, where the best fit of a core-shell model is also shown. It is evident that the fit does not match the data correctly and, thus, the mophology of the lipoprotein cannot be described with a simple core-shell model. The complementary measurements were performed by continuous contrast variation in SAXS using sucrose as contrast agent. The maximum sucrose mass fraction employed in the preparation of the density gradients was 40 $\%$, as detailed in section \ref{sec:lipoprotein_continuous}.

\subsubsection{PS-COOH particles coated with IgG}

The polystyrene nanoparticles with carboxylated surfaces (PS-COOH) described in chapter \ref{chap:density_gradient_SAXS} are coated with the protein Immunoglobulin G (IgG). A set of four IgG-coated polystyrene nanoparticle samples was prepared \textcolor{red}{by the Surface and Nanoanalysis group of NPL (Teddington, UK)} by incubating 0.05 $\%$ (w/w) particles with varying concentrations of IgG from 0.5 to 4 g L$^{-1}$ in 100 mM Tris buffer at pH 8 under continuous shaking for 2 h. Any unbound IgG was then removed from the particle samples by three cycles of centrifugation and redispersion in clean buffer.

In the continuous contrast variation experiment with sucrose as contrast agent, a protein concentration of 4 g L$^{-1}$ IgG was physisorbed at the surface of the bare PS-COOH particles. The details of the density gradient capillary are discussed in section \ref{sec:coated_kisker_continuous}.

\section{Traceable size determination of a liposomal drug}
\label{sec:caelyx_size}

\textcolor{red}{The first approved nano-drug, Caelyx, was rapidly followed by a few other products \citep{yeh_clinical_2011,barenholz_doxil-first_2012}.} Nowadays there are approximately 250 nanomedicine products that are either approved by the relevant health agencies or are under clinical trials \citep{etheridge_big_2013}. On the other hand, there is a translational gap between the experimental work devoted to the development of new nano-drug candidates and the clinical realization of their use, which is also reflected in the high number of studies dealing with nanomedicine and the number of approved products on the market \citep{venditto_cancer_2013}. As highlighted in a recent review by \cite{khorasani_closing_2014}, one of the main reasons for this translational gap is that the current characterization techniques possess limitations and there is a need for standardization in this field.

Among many relevant physicochemical properties of nano-drugs, one of the most important to be accurately determined is the size of the nanocarriers, which directly relates to the \emph{in vivo} biodistribution of the drug. The ultimate goal in this regard is to reach a traceable size determination of the nanomaterial and therefore the continuous contrast variation technique in SAXS is a suitable method to assess the size of a complex liposomal drug, such as the PEGylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin. 


%which means that the measurand can be related to the SI unit metre through an unbroken chain of comparisons with known uncertainties. 

%SAXS is capable of traceable size determination for sufficiently monodisperse nanoparticles \citep{meli_traceable_2012} and therefore the continuous contrast variation technique in SAXS is a suitable method to assess the size of a complex liposomal drug, such as the PEGylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin. 

\textcolor{red}{Osmolality is a measure of the balance in an aqueous medium between water and the solvated chemical components. It quantifies the osmotic pressure being exerted by the solute in the studied membrane and is typically given in osmoles (Osm) of solute per kilogram of solvent.} The need of an iso-osmolal suspending medium to mimic the physiological conditions of plasma \textcolor{red}{and avoid osmotic effects in the vesicle membrane} requires the use of Optiprep\textsuperscript{TM}\ (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) as contrast agent, an aqueous solution of iodixanol, which has an osmolality of 290 to 310 mOsm kg$^{-1}$. By employing Optiprep, the suspending medium osmolality can be kept constant along the density gradient capillary.
 
SAXS curves of the liposomal doxorubicin sample measured at different suspending medium electron densities are shown in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIodixanolContinuousSAXS}, where a maximum solvent electron density of 365.2 nm$^{-3}$ was reached with an Optiprep mass fraction of 35 $\%$. In the scattering curves, it is possible to observe the variation of the curve features through the increase of the suspending medium density, which indicates the complexity of the internal structure of the nanocarrier. Besides, the appearance of an isoscattering point around $q = 0.12$ nm$^{-1}$ is a further indicator of the structural complexity of the drug-carrier.

\begin{figure*}

Figure b) shows the precise position of the isoscattering points before and after the proper correction of the background.}
\end{figure*}

The solvent background has been subtracted by measuring the scattering curves of a density gradient of Optiprep and buffer without nanocarriers. The low scattering power of the PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin at high $q$ values and \textcolor{red}{the contribution of the Optiprep background result in a decreased signal-to-noise ratio in the high-$q$ range of the corrected scattering curves,} although in the Fourier region below $q = 0.3$ nm$^{-1}$ the background effect is much less dominant.

\subsection{Isoscattering point approach}
In the low $q$ part of the scattering curve, an isoscattering point is clearly visible as highlighted in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIodixanolContinuousSAXS}. The isoscattering point position relates directly to the external radius of the measured particle inaccessible to the solvent, as explained in section \ref{sec:isopoint_theory}. Therefore, the PEG-chains attached to the liposome surface might not be quantified in this approach due to the permeability of the polymer layer. The isoscattering point position is precisely determined by calculating the relative standard deviation of all the scattering curves at each $q$-value, as shown in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIodixanolIsopoint}. As discussed in chapter \ref{chap:density_gradient_SAXS}, the proper subtraction of the solvent background is essential for the right interpretation of the data, specially for intense scatterers like Optiprep. A clear shift in the minima of the relative standard deviation curve is observed in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIodixanolIsopoint} after correcting the background effects. Hence, the first isoscattering point $q^{\star}_1$ is \textcolor{red}{located at $q^{\star}_1 = \left(0.123\pm0.016\right)$ nm$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a diameter of $\left( 73 \pm 9 \right)$ nm.} A second isoscattering point at $q^{\star}_2 = \left(0.25\pm0.06\right)$ nm$^{-1}$ is still visible, although \textcolor{red}{the large diffuseness of the isoscattering points at higher $q$ values, related with the polydispersity of the ensemble and the possible ellipticity of the doxorubicin loaded liposomes, makes it less reliable for the determination of the outer diameter.}

%\textcolor{red}{The determination of the position of the isoscattering points has an associated relative uncertainty of 0.1 $\%$, which corresponds to a size uncertainty of 0.6 nm. Furthermore, the radial integration of the scattering pattern was performed choosing a $q$-bin of size 0.0015 nm$^{-1}$, with an associated uncertainty in the size of 0.9 nm. Without further considerations, the Caelyx size uncertainty associated to the determination of the $q$-value of the isoscattering point is 1.1 nm. Other possible sources of uncertainty arise from the polydispersity degree of the sample and the ellipticity of the doxorubicin loaded liposomes, which might shift the measured position of the isoscattering point, although the uncertainty associated to them cannot be easily quantified.}

\subsection{Shape scattering function calculation}
\textcolor{red}{In order to provide a complementary result to the diameter value obtained with the isoscattering point approach,} an alternative evaluation procedure has been used, namely the calculation of the shape scattering function introduced in section \ref{sec:basic_functions_theory} which extracts all contributions from the 30 measured scattering curves that change with the contrast at different solvent densities. The shape scattering function of the Caelyx sample contains essentially information only about the shape and size distribution of the space filled up by the liposomes, i.e. the contributions of the phospholipid bilayer and the encapsulated doxorubicin to the scattering intensity are cancelled. Thus, the complex interpretation of the original SAXS curve of Caelyx is avoided and enables the size determination of the liposomal carrier by fitting the analytical model for homogeneous spherical objects expressed by equation \ref{eq:ff_sphere} . A model with a certain ellipticity was also attempted using the expression \ref{eq:ff_ellipsoid}, due to the slight liposomal eccentricity observed in TEM images \citep{barenholz_doxil-first_2012} though the best fit was accomplished with a spherical model.

%		\label{fig:CaelyxIodixanolResonantTerm}
%\end{figure}

The shape scattering function calculated from the SAXS curves and the theoretical model fitting are depicted in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIodixanolResonantTerm}. The diameter obtained from the spherical form factor fit is (65.5 $\pm$ 4.7) nm, \textcolor{red}{smaller than the value calculated from the isoscattering point position but with a smaller associated uncertainty.}\textcolor{red}{Both values are in good agreement within their combined measurement uncertainties, considering that the uncertainty associated to the diffuseness of the isoscattering point arises from the polydispersity of the sample.} This fact is supported by the broad size distribution determined by the shape scattering function fitting. When assuming a Gaussian size distribution, the polydispersity degree of the nanocarrier is ca. 40$\%$. \textcolor{red}{Therefore, the weighted average value \textcolor{blue}{of (67 $\pm$ 5) nm} can be embraced as a reliable \textcolor{red}{external diameter} for the liposomal drug-carrier.} \textcolor{red}{The results of both approaches are summarized in table \ref{tab:comparison_results_caelyx} together with the diameter of Caelyx obtained with other techniques.}

\textcolor{red}{The average diameter obtained by contrast variation in SAXS} is smaller than the result obtained with DLS of ca. 86 nm, performed on a W130i apparatus (Avid Nano Ltd, High Wycombe, UK) \textcolor{red}{by the Institute of Materials and Environmental Chemistry (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary)} similarly to the protocol described in \cite{varga_osmotic_2014}. This deviation between both results can be attributed to the fact that the DLS measurand is the hydrodynamic size of the nanoparticles, while SAXS provides the size of the spherical volume inaccessible to the solvent. As the 2 kDa PEG-chains attached to the surface of the liposomes contribute to the hydrodynamic radius but that layer is permeable to the solvent and, therefore, invisible to contrast variation SAXS, \textcolor{red}{the ca. 20 nm difference} between the diameters determined by DLS and SAXS is justified.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Average electron density}
At low $q$-values, the Guinier approximation can be used as explained in section \ref{sec:TheoryGuinier}. By fitting the spherical form factor to the $q$-range just below the first minimum of the scattering curves, an extrapolated value for the intensity at zero-angle $I(0)$ could be obtained as displayed in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxAverageDensity}. The minimum of the parabola fitted to the experimental points determines the average electron density of the drug carrier system, according to the equation \ref{eq:I0}.

%		\label{fig:CaelyxAverageDensity}
%\end{figure}

From this calculation, a value of $\rho_0$ = (346.2 $\pm$ 1.2) nm$^{-3}$ is obtained which corresponds to a combination of the electron density of the liposomal nanocarrier and the precipitated doxorubicin drug. The uncertainty of 1.2 nm$^{-3}$ is associated with the vertical size of the focused X-ray beam. The obtained density is slightly higher than the value of 338 nm$^{-3}$ estimated for empty PEGylated liposomes \citep{kucerka_structure_2006} due to the presence of the doxorubicin-sulfate aggregate in the intraliposomal volume.

\section{Osmotic effects in liposomes}

The rigidity of the nanocarriers is a relevant property directly related with its drug delivery efficacy, the particle stability or the release rate of the encapsulated drug. In fact, some of these characteristics might change upon injection into the blood vessels due to the mechanical stress applied to the nanocarriers in the process. In the case of lipid vesicles, i.e. liposomes, the permeability of water through the phospholipid bilayer is a defining aspect of their physicochemical behaviour. Although many aspects about the membrane permeability have been studied \citep{nagle_theory_2008, mathai_structural_2008, olbrich_water_2000}, the evaluation of the liposomes rigidity and its osmotic activity is still challenging.

The osmotic behaviour of liposomes depends, basically, on their size and chemical composition. For example, the incorporation of cholesterol can vary the fluidity of the lipid bilayer. Larger liposomes tend to be osmotically active \citep{de_gier_osmotic_1993} and behave according to the Laplace law: the osmotic pressure needed to deform them decreases for increasing sizes. In the case of liposomal nanocarriers, the intraliposomal osmolality should be equal to the buffer outside of the liposomes to enhance the particle stability. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		{\resizebox{0.8\linewidth}{!}{\figfont{12pt}\input{Figures/OsmolalityElectronDensity}}}
		\caption[Relationship between the solvent electron density and the solvent osmolality for an aqueous sucrose solution.]{Relationship between the solvent electron density and the solvent osmolality for an aqueous sucrose solution.}
		\label{fig:OsmolalityElectronDensity}
\end{figure}

Therefore, it is an important question whether the incorporation of a drug into the intraliposomal volume might modify its osmotic activity. For example, it is expected that the small size of Caelyx and the doxorubicin-sulfate aggregate in the intraliposomal volume increase the resistance against the buffer osmotic pressure in comparison to an empty liposomal particle.  No osmotic pressure effects were observed in the size or density of the liposomal drug Caelyx in the previous section \ref{sec:caelyx_size} \textcolor{red}{due to the constant osmolality of the suspending medium along the whole density gradient that was achieved using Optiprep as contrast agent}.

However, this effect can be studied by increasing systematically the osmolality of the suspending medium \textcolor{red}{using aqueous sucrose in the buffer.} As shown in figure \ref{fig:OsmolalityElectronDensity}, the sucrose molecule acts simultaneously as a contrast agent and as an instrument to increase the solvent osmolality. This enables the study of the osmotic effects in liposomes \textcolor{red}{by the density gradient technique in SAXS using aqueous sucrose as suspending medium.}

In this section, a thorough investigation of Caelyx under the effects of an increasing solvent osmolality is performed, complementary to the study of the empty liposomal nanocarrier under similar conditions. Besides, the consequences of PEGylation on the liposomal structure are also studied using this technique, focusing principally in its osmotic activity. 


\subsection{Application to drug-stabilized liposomes}
\label{sec:OsmoticCaelyx}
By means of the density gradient technique, scattering curves of the liposomal doxorubicin were recorded at different sucrose concentrations of the suspending medium, i.e. at different buffer osmolalities, as shown in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXS}. A maximum osmolality preparation was achieved with a 37.8 $\%$ sucrose mass fraction, which corresponds to an electron density of 381.1 nm$^{-3}$ and a solvent osmolality of 1776 mOsm kg$^{-1}$,  whereas a lighter solution was produced without sucrose by adding pure water to get the same Caelyx concentration. Considering the sucrose mass fraction of the Caelyx buffer to be 10$\%$, this latter preparation has an electron density of 339.4 nm$^{-3}$ and an osmolality of 151 mOsm kg$^{-1}$. The X-ray scattering measurements were performed at two different detector-to-sample distances, in order to study a broader $q$-range, spanning from 0.03 to 5.55 nm$^{-1}$. \textcolor{red}{Using the WAXS configuration described in section~\ref{sec:WAXS_experimental}, the 1,0-diffraction peak of the doxorubicin fiber-like precipitate around $q=2.3$ nm$^{-1}$ \citep{li_doxorubicin_1998} was observed, as depicted in the figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousWAXS} after proper background correction. This Bragg diffractions arises from the crystalline nature of the doxorubicin aggregate in the intraliposomal volume.}


%\textcolor{red}{, and observe the 1,0-diffraction peak of the doxorubicin fiber-like precipitate around $q=2.3$ nm$^{-1}$ \citep{li_doxorubicin_1998}, as depicted in the figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousWAXS} after proper background correction.}

An osmotic threshold appears at 670 mOsm kg$^{-1}$. The experiment was measured with two different configurations with identical results.}
\end{figure*}

As discussed in the previous section, by increasing the electron density of the suspending medium, the scattering curves of the drug carrier change drastically due to contrast variation. In the case of the aqueous sucrose gradient shown in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXS}, this effect is also observed and strongly resembles the curves measured with the Optiprep density gradient depicted in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIodixanolContinuousSAXS}. Nevertheless, upon a certain sucrose concentration (corresponding to osmolalities around 900 mOsm kg$^{-1}$ in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXS}), the features of the scattering curves change abruptly, because the suspending medium osmolality is so high that it induces morphological changes in the liposomal structure and, consequently, the scattering form factor of the particles changes.

This effect can be quantified by examining the scattering intensity at the first isoscattering point position ($q^{\star}_1 = 0.123$ nm$^{-1}$) as a function of the suspending medium osmolality, as shown in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXSIsopoint}. The intensity of the isoscattering points is independent of the electron density of the solvent as long as the size and the shape of the investigated particle remain constant. However, there is a clear osmolality threshold at 670 mOsm kg$^{-1}$ in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXSIsopoint} when the intensity at $q^{\star}_1$ decays drastically. Above this threshold, the osmotic pressure at the liposomal bilayer is so high that the liposome starts shrinking and changes its size, structure and, consequently, scattering form factor. The increased resistance against osmotic pressure, more than double the blood plasma osmolality and much higher than the osmolality needed to shrink empty PEGylated liposomes \citep{varga_osmotic_2014}, is explained by the encapsulation of crystal-like doxorubicin inside the liposome.

The large osmotic pressure produces a reversible shrinkage of the liposome though it is not capable of cracking it. This was proved in an additional experiment by increasing the osmolality of the buffer to 1334 mOsm kg$^{-1}$ with a sucrose mass fraction of 31.4$\%$ and then reducing it to 565 mOsm kg$^{-1}$ by adding distilled water\textcolor{red}{, where it was observed in the scattering curves that the osmotic shrinkage process is reversible.}


% The solvent with high osmolality produced a featureless scattering curve, as expected from figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXS}, whereas, after reducing the osmotic pressure, the scattering curve was the same as the measured Caelyx curve with the corresponding electron density, which gives evidence that the osmotic shrinkage process is reversible.

The behaviour of the nano-drug for an increasing solvent osmolality can be further studied by evaluating the crystal structure of the doxorubicin aggregate, represented by the diffraction peak displayed in the figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousWAXS}. For this purpose, a WAXS configuration was employed which extends the available $q$-range until 5.55 nm$^{-1}$ by reducing the sample-to-detector distance to $L = (569 \pm  1)$ mm. The position of the peak in the reciprocal space depending on the suspending medium osmolality is depicted in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousWAXSDiffraction} and shows that its position deviates less than 1 $\%$ from the weighted average $q=2.28$ nm$^{-1}$ along the whole osmolality range. This proves that the fiber-like structure of the drug inside the liposome is also constant during the osmotic shrinkage of the liposomes. The measured position of the (1,0) diffraction peak matches exactly the value measured from doxorubicin-sulfate complexes in solution \citep{lasic_gelation_1992}. 
%\textcolor{blue}{It can also be observed in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousWAXSDiffraction} how the width of the diffraction peak does not change significantly along the osmolality range and thus, according to the Scherrer equation \citep{cullity_elements_2001}, the size of the precipated doxorubicin remains stable upon the osmotic shrinkage.}

To conclude this section, the diameter obtained from the isoscattering position in the Optiprep solution can be compared with what is measured in an aqueous sucrose suspending medium. In the latter, if only the scattering curves below this osmolality threshold are considered, the relative standard deviation for each $q$ value reveals a pronounced minimum for the first isoscattering point as depicted in figure \ref{fig:CaelyxIsopointComparison}. When comparing this result with the relative standard deviation curve obtained from the Optiprep contrast variation measurements, both values for the size of the drug carrier agree remarkably well within 2 $\%$. This reflects the independence of the technique from the contrast agent added to the suspending medium and shows the repeatability of the results.

\subsection{Does PEGylation affect the osmotic activity of liposomes?}
\label{sec:liposome_osmotic}

Typically, unilamellar liposomes present a very narrow size distribution and spherical shape, whose diameter ranges from 50 nm to some hundreds of nanometres. The covalent attachment of biocompatible polymers can improve the liposome stability. For example, PEG polymer chains show very low toxicity \citep{yamaoka_distribution_1994} and are widely used as stabilizer \citep{sou_polyethylene_2000}. PEGylated liposomal formulations, also called sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL) or \emph{stealth} liposomes, show longer blood circulation times \emph{in vivo} \citep{barenholz_liposome_2001} and exhibit a slow drug release rate. PEG-modified liposomes have become of importance lately due to their increased drug pharmakinetics, decreased plasma clearance and improved patient convenience \citep{gabizon_polyethylene_1997,harris_effect_2003}. Therefore, the self-assembly of lipid structures in the presence of PEG moieties has been studied for different lipids \citep{lee_coarse-grained_2011}.

The incorporation of biocompatible polymers increases the phospholipid bilayer strength and enhances the vesicle rigidity, which relates to the increase of the bending modulus \citep{liang_effect_2005, sou_polyethylene_2000}. The higher membrane stiffness of SSLs has been extensively characterized with methods such as AFM \citep{spyratou_atomic_2009} though other techniques such as light scattering have found a higher osmotic activity in SSLs in comparison to their non-PEGylated counterparts when incubated in serum \citep{wolfram_shrinkage_2014}. Further investigations about the relationship between PEGylation and the liposomal osmotic behaviour in suspension are essential. In the following work, the different response of SSLs and plain liposomes to osmotic pressure is studied by SAXS. 

For this purpose, five PEGylated and three plain liposomes were extruded with different pore sizes, as explained in section \ref{sec:materials_liposome}. To simplify the following discussion, the liposomes are named after the hydrodynamic diameter measured by DLS. It is apparent from these measurements that the size of the pore and the polydispersity degree of the liposome sample are directly related.

%\end{figure}

The SAXS measurements of the eight liposomes are shown in figure \ref{fig:SSLSingleContrast}, where the first minimum  $q$-value ranges from $\sim$0.1 nm$^{-1}$ in the 81 nm SSL to $\sim$0.05 nm$^{-1}$ for larger sizes. For high polydispersities this scattering minimum gets smeared out, as it can be observed for the 274 nm SSL. It can be stated from these measurements and the DLS results that the polydispersity degree rises for increasing liposomal sizes. Besides, non-PEGylated liposomes show slightly broader size distributions than SSLs.

\end{figure*}

Focusing on the high $q$-region of the single-contrast SAXS curves as displayed in figure \ref{fig:SSLSingleContrastBilayer}, the scattering feature related to the phospholipid bilayer structure is observed. For Unilamellar Vesicles (ULV), the feature shape is typically round with a maximum around $q=0.86$ nm$^{-1}$ \citep{varga_characterization_2012}\textcolor{red}{, related to a distance ($d=\sfrac{2\pi}{q}$) of 7.3 nm,} as it can be seen in the case of small PEGylated liposomes. For SSLs extruded with larger pores, the bilayer shape shows incipient Bragg peaks which suggest the simultaneous presence of Multilamellar Vesicles (MLV) with a lamellar repeat distance of 7.3 nm and unilamellar SSLs. These \emph{quasi Bragg peaks} arise from the periodic structure of the phospholipid bilayer and the water layers, which interact through a combination of the electrostatic potential, the Van der Wals attraction and other hydration terms. Nevertheless, the MLV population cannot exceed the total number of unilamellar liposomes because the scattering contribution from ULV is still clearly dominant \citep{sakuragi_transformation_2011}. \textcolor{red}{The schematic representation of the different types of liposomes and the graphical definition of the lamellar repeat distance are depicted in figure \ref{fig:ULVMLVScheme}.}

The bilayer feature of the plain liposomes differs completely from the round shape visible in unilamellar vesicles. The diffraction peaks appearing at $q_1=0.88$ and $q_2=1.9\simeq2q_1$ nm$^{-1}$ correspond to a slightly smaller lamellar repeat distance of 7.1 nm and are related to a more pronounced presence of MLVs, possibly of Oligolamellar Vesicles (OLV) with only a few lamellae. This tendency is emphasized for larger plain vesicles, as observed for the 128 nm plain liposome, where the round shape of the scattering feature practically disappears. This observation suggests that the plain liposomes distribution consists of bi-, oligo- and multilamellar liposomes in a much higher ratio than the SSLs.

The effect of PEGylation induces a higher ratio of ULVs due to the increased negative charge of the phospholipid bilayer in comparison to plain liposomes, which hinders the creation of periodic lamellar structures. Nevertheless, small populations of OLVs and MLVs coexisting with unilamellar liposomes can be observed for large extrusion pore sizes in SSLs as well. In conclusion, the size and composition of the liposomes affect remarkably the formation of unilamellar vesicles and the shape of the phospholipid bilayer.

The behaviour of the different liposomal structures to osmotic stress can be examined with a continuous contrast variation experiment using sucrose as contrast agent, similarly to the measurements with the Caelyx sample in section \ref{sec:OsmoticCaelyx}. The scattering curves measured for a PEGylated liposome with diameter 81 nm are displayed in figure \ref{fig:SSLContinuousSAXS}, where the solvent osmolality has been increased until 1409 mOsm kg$^{-1}$ using a maximum sucrose mass fraction of 27.3 $\%$. From the low $q$-region of these scattering curves some facts can be extracted which reveal preliminary the structural changes of the liposome induced by the osmotic pressure.

		\label{fig:ULVMLVScheme}
\end{figure*}

The curves do not intersect clearly in one point, even for low sucrose concentrations as occured in the Caelyx case. The absence of an evident isoscattering point can be related with the shape variation of the liposome already at small osmotic pressures. However, a diffuse intersection point, or pseudo isoscattering point \citep{kawaguchi_application_2004}, is visible at $q=0.18$ nm$^{-1}$. A very similar behaviour can be observed for the plain 89 nm liposome in figure \ref{fig:PlainLiposomeContinuousSAXS}, where the suspending medium osmolality is increased until 1885 mOsm kg$^{-1}$ by a 35 $\%$ sucrose mass fraction. In analogy to figure \ref{fig:CaelyxSucroseContinuousSAXSIsopoint}, the intensity at the pseudo $q^{\star}$ as a function of the solvent osmolality is depicted in figure \ref{fig:SSLIsopointIntensity}, as the deviation from the original intensity for a plain and a PEGylated liposome of similar diameters.

The intensity at $q^{\star}$ starts diverging from the original value already at very low solvent osmolalitites and reflects the continuous change in shape or size of the liposome when increasing the osmotic pressure. This behaviour occurs for both SSLs and plain liposomes and suggest that a sharp osmotic threshold, like in the Caelyx case, does not exist. Thus, the response of liposomes to osmotic pressure is steady and is already apparent at low osmolalities.

\begin{figure*}

The positions of the pseudo isoscattering points at $q=0.18$ nm$^{-1}$ and $q=0.16$ nm$^{-1}$ are marked for the PEGylated and plain liposomes respectively.}
\end{figure*}

Besides, an evident variation of the scattering curves below $q\leq0.3$ nm$^{-1}$ is observed in figure \ref{fig:SSLContinuousSAXS} when increasing the solvent osmolality. For example, the minimum originally appearing at 0.1 nm$^{-1}$ shifts slightly to larger $q$-values and disappears almost completely for high sucrose concentrations. This variation of the form factor can be caused by the flattening of the liposomal shape observed with Freeze-fracture TEM \citep{varga_osmotic_2014}. Due to the increased osmotic activity, the original spherical liposome shrinks into an oblate spheroid. This hypothesis can be further explored by focusing on the scattering feature related to the phospholipid bilayer at the high $q$-region.

For this purpose, the bilayer feature of the 179 nm PEGylated liposome is shown in figure \ref{fig:SSLContrastCurvesBilayer200SSL} for increasing solvent osmolalities. As observed in figure \ref{fig:SSLContinuousSAXS} for sucrose concentrations above 15 $\%$, the bilayer scattering feature shifts abruptly to smaller $q$-values. This large contrast effect occurs at solvent densities close to the average electron density of the phospholipid bilayer (ca. 348 nm$^{-3}$), which corresponds to a sucrose mass fraction of $\sim 12 \; \%$. The convolution of the contrast-related effects with the variations induced by the osmotic pressure demands a more challenging evaluation, can prevent the right interpretation of the data and is, thus, unwanted. Therefore, the scattering curves shown here were measured with sucrose concentrations $\leq10\;\%$.

		\label{fig:SSLIsopointIntensity}
\end{figure}

The original double-peak structure of the SSL at 0 $\%$ sucrose concentration observed in figure \ref{fig:SSLContrastCurvesBilayer200SSL} transforms upon increasing the solvent osmolality and splits into three peaks of decreasing intensity at $q_1=0.48$ nm$^{-1}$, $q_2=0.86$ nm$^{-1}$ and $q_3=1.28$ nm$^{-1}$. These Bragg peaks superimposed on the bilayer form factor reveal a periodic structure which can be related with a partial oligolamellar structure in the liposome system \citep{fernandez_influence_2008}. The three mentioned diffraction peaks translate into a lamellar repeat distance of ca. 13 nm, approximately doubling the thickness of the single phospholipid bilayer \citep{kenworthy_range_1995} and suggesting the appearance of a bilamellar structure \citep{deme_giant_2002}. 

The transition between a single bilayer phase and a bilamellar phase at 10 $\%$ sucrose concentration supports the hypothesis presented above that the liposome shrinks into lens-shaped vesicles due to the osmotic pressure. The bilamellar structure might arise from the close bilayer contacts at the outest part of the elliptical liposomes, while the single bilayer conformation still remains dominant in the midsection of the liposomes. A similar morphology has been observed after the osmotic shrinkage of DPPC/DSPE-PEG$_{2000}$ vesicles \citep{terreno_osmotically_2009}. In fact, this behaviour was identical for all five studied PEGylated liposomes, independent of their size.

There are no sharp transitions, thus the osmotic effect is continuously modfying the bilayer structure.}
%		\label{fig:SSLContrastVariationChiSquared400SSL}
%\end{figure}

Besides, the changes of the phospholipid bilayer form factor are smooth upon increasing the osmotic pressure as shown in figure \ref{fig:SSLContrastCurvesBilayer200SSL}, where the bilayer scattering feature starts varying at very low sucrose concentrations. This validates the observation from figure \ref{fig:SSLIsopointIntensity} and confirms that the increasing solvent osmolality affects continuously the structure of the liposomes and not as abruptly as in the case of Caelyx.

Contrarily, the phospholipid bilayer of the plain liposomes remains unchanged upon increasing the solvent osmolality until 1285 mOsm kg$^{-1}$, as displayed in figure \ref{fig:SSLContrastCurvesBilayer100Plain}. This suggests that the MLV structure of the non-PEGylated vesicles increase their resilience and the multiple phospholipid bilayers strengthen the elastic modulus of the liposome membrane.

The fact that the incorporation of PEG moieties influences already the preparation and formation of the liposomes prevents a proper comparison of the osmotic effects between SSLs and plain liposomes of similar diameters. \textcolor{red}{The existence of MLVs for non-PEGylated liposomes acts as a limiting factor for the osmotic activity and contrasts with the osmotic effects observed in unilamellar SSLs already at low sucrose concentrations, which shrinks the PEGylated liposomes into oblated ellipsoids.} 

The chemical effect of sucrose on the SSL membrane is a subject of discussion, because it can be argued that the disaccharide molecule penetrates the lipid membrane or creates a solvation shell around the liposomes. However, previous studies in this subject \citep{ kiselev_sucrose_2001-2, kiselev_sucrose_2001,kiselev_does_2003}, the large size of the sucrose molecule and similar results with other experiments performed with salt \citep{varga_osmotic_2014} suggest otherwise. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study of the osmotic activity of liposomes can be performed successfully using aqueous sucrose and shows very distinguishable effects for ULVs (PEGylated liposomes) and MLVs (plain liposomes).

\section{Sizing of blood plasma componenents}
\label{sec:lipoprotein_continuous}

From a nanoscience point of view, human blood can be seen as a suspension of particles with different physiological roles, where important components are in the nanorange. Serum lipoproteins are the colloidal particles involved in the transport and metabolism of insoluble lipids and are among the most studied biological particles. The interest in their activity is understandable due to their direct relationship with very extended diseases in the Western world population, such as obesity or atherogenesis, e.g. obturation of the arterial walls. For example, the dysregulation of cholesterol in plasma, primarily carried within lipoproteins, is responsible of atherosclerosis \citep{munro_pathogenesis_1988}. Besides, they are a convenient model for lipid-protein interactions \citep{assmann_lipid-protein_1974} due to their lipid core and the hydrated proteins isometrically situated on its surface.

Lipoproteins are isolated from blood plasma by ultracentrifugation \citep{havel_distribution_1955} and are normally classified by their density range, showing different chemical composition, size and pathological condition for each class \citep{german_lipoproteins:_2006}. Indeed, the size of lipoproteins is critically connected with disease risk \citep{gardner_association_1996} and Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) are suggested to be more or less atherogenic depending on their size \citep{dreon_low-density_1994}. The effect of diabetes on the lipoprotein size is also of great interest, especially the sex-dependency of the High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) size \citep{colhoun_lipoprotein_2002}.

Therefore, precise sizing techniques are a crucial tool to understand the physiological processes of lipoproteins \citep{german_lipoproteins:_2006}. The naturally narrow size distributions of LDL and HDL suggest small-angle scattering as a well-suited method and their heterogeneous morphology advises the use of a contrast variation approach. For instance, the first characterization attempts date back to the late 1970s with neutron scattering \citep{stuhrmann_neutron_1975}, using salt \citep{tardieu_structure_1976} and sucrose \citep{muller_structure_1978} as SAXS contrast agents or modifying the sample temperature \citep{laggner_molecular_1977,luzzati_structure_1979}.

		\caption[Continuous contrast variation experimental data of HDL and LDL.]{Scattering curves of HDL and LDL measured at different solvent densities by using an aqueous sucrose density gradient.}
\end{figure*}

The complicated inner structure of the lipoproteins revealed in more recent studies \citep{baumstark_structure_1990,schnitzer_re-evaluation_1994} encourages the use of parameter-independent and model-free analysis of the scattering data. With this objective, LDL and HDL samples were measured with continuous contrast variation in SAXS using 40 $\%$ sucrose mass fraction to increase the solvent electron density until 384 nm$^{-3}$. The scattering curves obtained for HDL and LDL are presented in figures \ref{fig:HDLContinuousSAXS} and \ref{fig:LDLContinuousSAXS} respectively.

In the case of HDL in buffer, the first minimum appears at $q\approx0.5$ nm$^{-1}$. By increasing the solvent density, this minimum shifts to smaller $q$-values hinting the denser composition of the protein shell in comparison to the lighter lipid and cholesterol core. A lighter core morphology is also expected for LDL \citep{luzzati_structure_1979} and it agrees with the contrast effect observed in the scattering curves displayed in figure \ref{fig:LDLContinuousSAXS}.

\begin{figure*}

		\caption[Model free-approaches to the experimental data of HDL and LDL.]{Comparison of the model free approaches for HDL (red) and LDL (black)}
\end{figure*}

The large number of observable minima indicates the narrow size distributions of both samples, providing ideal conditions to use the isoscattering point $q^{\star}$ approach. The relative standard deviation as a function of $q$ calculated for both lipoproteins is shown in figure \ref{fig:LipoproteinIsopointComp}, where the minima correspond to the position of $q^{\star}_i$. \textcolor{red}{The clear minimum for HDL is located at $q^{\star}=\left( 0.83 \pm 0.14 \right)$ nm$^{-1}$, corresponding to an impenetrable diameter for the solvent of $\left( 11 \pm 2 \right)$ nm. The position of the first $q^{\star}$ in LDL is shifted to smaller $q$, $q^{\star}= \left( 0.42 \pm 0.08 \right)$ nm$^{-1}$, which translates into a solvent-excluded diameter of $\left( 21 \pm 4 \right)$ nm.}

Considering that the lipoproteins are quasi-spherical \citep{stuhrmann_neutron_1975}, these results can be compared to those extracted from literature. The different cholesterol tranport necessities reflect into a large variety of HDL subclasses with a diameter range between 7 and 13 nm \citep{german_lipoproteins:_2006}. For example, a diameter of 13 nm was observed for the subclass type HDL3 \citep{tardieu_structure_1976}, which deviates only 15 $\%$ from the result measured in our study. Difficulties to know the measured subclass of the commercially purchased HDL hinders a more thorough comparison.

In the case of LDL, several studies provide diameters between 21 and 28 nm \citep{tardieu_structure_1976,colhoun_lipoprotein_2002,german_lipoproteins:_2006}, though the most repeated values lay around 22 to 23 nm \citep{muller_structure_1978,luzzati_structure_1979}, less than 10 $\%$ deviation from our result. Nevertheless, the possible solvent penetration into the outer layers of LDL \citep{stuhrmann_neutron_1975,tardieu_structure_1976} calls for caution as the diameter obtained from the $q^{\star}$ position considers an impenetrable particle.

The effects of permeability and protein hydration might be related to the density of the lipoprotein, which is the most characteristic feature of each lipoprotein class. As described previously, the intensity at zero-angle is related to the average electron density by the expression \ref{eq:I0} and can be measured. The experimental $I(q=0)$ values are depicted in figure \ref{fig:LipoproteinsAverageDensity}, where the fits of the previous equation are shown as solid lines. 

According to the analytical fit, \textcolor{red}{the average density of HDL is $\left( 358.4 \pm 1.5 \right)$ nm$^{-3}$ and the density measured in the LDL case is $\left(345 \pm 2 \right)$ nm$^{-3}$.} In the latter, \textcolor{red}{the low number of points measured below the average density of LDL due to the limited range given by the water electron density (333 nm$^{-3}$) increases the uncertainty of the result,} although the value is still in pretty good agreement with other SAXS studies \citep{tardieu_structure_1976,luzzati_structure_1979}. The protein-rich ($\sim 50 \; \% $) structure of HDL explains its higher density in comparison to LDL, composed mainly of lipids ($\sim 80 \; \% $).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\input{Figures/HDLGuinierRadius}
\caption[Squared radius of the HDL scattering data.]{Squared radius of the HDL scattering data. The analytical fit results in \textcolor{red}{an average density of $\left(353.6 \pm 1.5 \right)$ nm$^{-3}$ and an external diameter of $\left(12 \pm 2 \right)$ nm.}}
		\label{fig:HDLGuinierRadius}
\end{figure}

Another model-free interpretation of the HDL scattering data is presented in figure \ref{fig:HDLGuinierRadius}, where the the squared radius of the Guinier region is presented as a function of the solvent electron density. As previously shown, the analytical expression \ref{eq:guinier} can be fitted to the experimental data, resulting in an \textcolor{red}{average electron density $\rho_0=\left(353.6 \pm 1.5 \right)$ nm$^{-3}$ and a particle shape radius of $R_c=\left(6 \pm 1 \right)$ nm. The diameter obtained with this approach, $\left(12 \pm 2 \right)$ nm,} is consistent with the previous result. Probably due to the absence of relevant experimental points around the match point, the average density differs by almost 5 nm$^{-3}$ from the $I(0)$ result.

The continuous contrast variation technique and the subsequent model-free analysis are easy and effective tools to measure the size and density of lipoproteins, very important attributes to understand the biological processes related to cholesterol and lipid transport. A more detailed analysis and modelling of the scattering data could have addressed some issues such as the hydration and distribution of the proteins on the surface, the permeability of the steric and lipid core or the radial distribution of cholesterol and triglycerides in the lipoprotein.


\section{Protein-coated low-density nanoparticles}
\label{sec:CoatedKiskerExperimental}
The most recent efforts in nanomedicine aim for a high control of the characteristics of the nanocarrier surface, as the surface's properties are a defining element of its efficiency as drug carrier. Besides, nanoparticles interact with proteins when introduced into biological media, leading to the formation of the so-called \emph{protein corona} surrounding the nanocarrier \citep{cedervall_understanding_2007,monopoli_physical-chemical_2011,casals_time_2010}. The identity of the biomolecule coating depends on the particle size, surface functionalization and charge \citep{lundqvist_nanoparticle_2008,tenzer_rapid_2013,gessner_functional_2003} and its detailed description is challenging. Yet, the ability to quantitatively characterise this interface is important in understanding particle behaviour in these complex environments and improving their surface engineering for enhanced functionality.

IgG is the most common type of antibody found in human serum and, therefore, a logical candidate to coat the studied nanoparticles with. In this case, we used commercially available PS-COOH particles, because polystyrene NPs are commonly used in the development of nanoparticle-based strategies for medicine, thanks to the low cost of their material and the versatility of their surface functionalization. The carboxylated surface prevents the agglomeration of the particles and also provides a chemical anchor for the protein binding. The use of SAXS to obtain a quantitative description of the protein corona is examined for different IgG concentrations, e.g. shell thicknesses, and compared with DLS and DCS \citep{minelli_characterization_2014}.

\textcolor{red}{The bare PS-COOH particles are highly charged, translating into a high $\zeta$-potential, i.e. strong repulsive electrostatic potential on the particle surface. A $\zeta$-potential of ($-49 \pm 1$) mV was measured, which is drastically reduced to around $ -10$ mV following the binding of the positively charged IgG.} The SAXS measurements of the IgG-coated particles with different protein concentrations are shown in figure \ref{fig:CoatedKiskerIgGSingleContrastSAXS}, where a clear shift to smaller $q$-values is observed for increasing concentration of IgG. This effect is clearly related with the increase in size for higher IgG concentration, although a quantitative description is complicated.
 
Due to the core-shell morphology of the polymeric bare particle observed in chapter \ref{chap:density_gradient_SAXS}, SAXS curves were analysed using a double-shell model based in the form factor \ref{eq:multicore-shell}, considering a sharp interface between the different components and a constant thickness and density of the IgG corona. In order to focus on the total diameter instead of the details of the internal structure, the limits of the inner and outer radii of the polymer shell are not fixed and are treated as fitting parameters together with the outer radius and the contrast difference of each shell with the polystyrene core.

The IgG shell thickness obtained for IgG-coated particles with different protein concentrations is shown in table \ref{tab:CoatedKiskerSingleContrast} and compared to the size measurements performed with other techniques by the Surface and Nanoanalysis group of NPL (Teddington, UK). All techniques (DLS, DCS and SAXS) show an increase in the IgG-shell thickness with increasing concentration of the protein in solution during incubation. As expected, DLS provides higher values than the other techniques, as the measured thickness is related to the hydrodynamic properties of the system.

Although all techniques show an increase of the IgG shell thickness with increasing concentration of the protein, full consistency among them \textcolor{red}{requires the calculation of a combined measurement uncertainty and} further refinements of the SAXS and DCS modelling. For instance, the SAXS evaluation has neglected the possible spatial heterogeneity and hydration of the IgG corona and the model employed for the core particle overestimates the diameter by almost 10 $\%$ (chapter \ref{chap:density_gradient_SAXS} and \cite{minelli_characterization_2014}).

\subsection{Hard protein corona characterization with contrast variation}
\label{sec:coated_kisker_continuous}

\end{figure}

The possible inaccuracies arising from the previous modelling approach might be prevented by using continuous contrast variation and a model-free evaluation. For this purpose, the protein-coated particle with 4 mg mL$^{-1}$ IgG was introduced in a density gradient with sucrose as contrast agent, resulting in an increase of the solvent electron density until 350.8 nm$^{-3}$ at the maximum sucrose concentration of 14.7 $\%$. The isoscattering point position is quantified by calculating the relative standard deviation of the 20 measured curves at each $q$, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:CoatedKiskerIsopointComp}. This value becomes minimal at $q = \left( 0.080\pm0.011 \right)$ nm$^{-1}$.

By comparing in figure \ref{fig:CoatedKiskerIsopointComp} the relative standard deviation curves of the bare PS-COOH particle obtained in chapter \ref{chap:density_gradient_SAXS} and the IgG-coated sample, it is noticeable that the position of the minimum is shifted to smaller $q$-values after the adsorption of proteins to the surface as a consequence of the increase in size. The diameter increase $t$ can be quantified by inserting in equation \ref{eq:isoscattering} the \textcolor{red}{isoscattering positions before and after the target attachment, $q^{\star}=\left( 0.090 \pm 0.006 \right)$ nm$^{-1}$ and $q^{\star}_{IgG}=\left( 0.080 \pm 0.011 \right)$ nm$^{-1}$ respectively.} Combining both results, $t$ is expressed by:

\begin{equation}
t = R_{\text{IgG}} - R = \frac{\kappa}{q^{\star}_{\text{IgG}}}-\frac{\kappa}{q^{\star}} ,
\label{eq:IsopointRadiusDifference}
\end{equation}

where \textcolor{red}{$\kappa = 4.493$,} $t$ is the IgG-shell thickness and $R$ and $R_{IgG}$ are the particle radii before and after IgG incubation. This results in a \textcolor{red}{shell thickness of (7 $\pm$ 8) nm, where the uncertainty associated to the thickness ($\delta t$) can be derived from the expression \ref{eq:IsopointRadiusDifference} as:}

\begin{equation}
\delta t^2 = \left( \frac{\kappa}{\left(q^{\star}_{\text{IgG}}\right)^2} \cdot \delta q^{\star}_{\text{IgG}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\kappa}{\left(q^{\star}\right)^2} \cdot \delta q^{\star}\right)^2
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{where $\delta q^{\star}_{\text{IgG}}=0.011$ nm$^{-1}$ and $\delta q^{\star}=0.006$ nm$^{-1}$ arise from the diffuseness of the isoscattering point position. This large uncertainty is mainly explained by the low concentration of coated particles in suspension due to the IgG-incubation process. The decreased scattering contribution of the particles in comparison to the medium limits the signal-to-noise ratio and thus the accuracy of the isoscattering point determination. Besides, the use of sucrose in the solution might disturb the solvation shell around the particles and vary the hydration properties of the protein-corona. Such an effect is difficult to detect though it can affect strongly the scattering curves when the electron density of the medium and the probed particle are similar.}

Although the relative uncertainty associated to the shell thickness is $>100\;\%$, it is important to highlight that $t$ corresponds to the volume inaccessible for the solvent and, thus, it can be identified with the hard protein corona surrounding the polymeric nanoparticle, i.e. the impermeable part of the IgG shell. \textcolor{red}{Nevertheless, the large associated uncertainty suggests that this technique is inappropriate for the accurate determination of the thickness of a hard protein corona.}
