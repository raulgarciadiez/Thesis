\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the people that have contributed to the conclusion of this thesis and have supported me during these years to reach this goal.
\vspace{2ex}

\noindent First of all, I would like to thank \emph{Dr. Michael Krumrey}, the leader of the working group Röntgenradiometrie and the person who provided me the proper human and scientific environment to perform high-profile experiments and pursue my research interests. Without his constant supervision and expert advise, the completion of this Thesis would have been virtually impossible.

\noindent I am very grateful also to \emph{Prof. Dr. Mathias Richter} for giving me the opportunity to participate on the activity of the PTB in BESSY II and encourage me to chase my scientific goals.
\vspace{2ex}

\noindent \emph{Prof. Dr. Stefan Eisebitt} and \emph{Prof. Dr. Simone Raoux} are also kindly acknowledged for the precious advice given to complete my research work and for the interest to read and prove this written thesis.

\noindent I am greatly indebted to my mentor \emph{Dr. Christian Gollwitzer} for his supervision and honest interest throughout these last 4 years. His valuable scientific input cannot overshadow the great moments we spent together in the laboratory.
