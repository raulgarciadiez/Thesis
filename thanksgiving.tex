The conclusion of this Master Thesis would have been impossible without the help of so many people, who I would like in this opportunity to thank and acknowledge here.

\noindent Laborortory of the Physikalisch-Technischen Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Electron Storage Ring BESSY II from Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB),

\noindent First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Michael Krumrey, the person who made possible this Thesis happening. It has been a great opportunity for me to be part of this team, Rontgen Metrologie, which provided me the chance to make high-profile experiments and a proper environment to develop my goals. Without the supervision, expert adivse and suggestions of Dr. Krumrey, the satisfactory achievement of this thesis’s goals would have been impossible.
