\section{BESSY II}

\subsubsection{Electron Accelerator}

The electron beam creates the free electrons: a hot thermionic cathode emits electrons which are accelerated with a high voltage to the anode until they reach energies up to 70 keV. The free electrons are transferred to a linear pre-accelerator which accelerates electrons to relativistic velocities up to 0.99c via an electric field. The electrons are then inserted into the microtron, which further accelerates the electrons to 50 MeV, at which point they are injected into the synchrotron. The acceleration process takes 50 ms and can be repeated with a repetition rate of 10 Hz with successive injection of electrons. Inside the synchrotron, a set of magnets are disposed in such a way as to lead the electrons in circular trajectories, whilst high frequency (HF) resonators in linear paths of the synchrotron, temporally coupled with the magnets, further accelerate the electrons to 1.72 GeV 18 .

\subsubsection{Storage ring}

The threshold energy is reached when a high electron flux with high temporal stability is achieved. At this point the electrons are injected into the storage ring, where bending magnets are implemented to maintain the circular trajectory of the electron, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BessyScheme}. The storage ring has a circumference of 240 meters and the successive injection of electrons from the synchrotron leads to currents of approximately 290 mA in the initial stage (after injection).

\subsection{Insertion devices}

\subsubsection{Bending magent and bremsstrahlung radiation}
It is known that relativistic electrons lose kinetic energy due to the Bremsstrahlung process\citep{blumenthal_bremsstrahlung_1970} when they are accelerated or deaccelerated. This energy loss in the storage ring is compensated by high frequency resonators situated on a short linear section. In the case of a storage ring with circular shape, the electron bunches are accelerated radially (a perp v) and emit synchrotron radiation tangentially to the bunch trajectory. The power emitted


Total radiated power:
\begin{equation}
        P=\frac{e^2\gamma^4}{6\pi\epsilon_0c}\left( \dot{\beta}^2 + \frac{(\dot{\vec{\beta}} \cdot \vec{\beta})^2}{1-\beta^2} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\beta}=\frac{\vec{v}}{c}$ and $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.

If the trajectory of the electrons and the acceleration are perpendicular, for circular particle trajectories:
\begin{equation}
        P_{a \bot v}=\frac{e^2\gamma^4}{6\pi\epsilon_0c}\dot{\beta}^2=\frac{e^2\gamma^4a^2}{6\pi\epsilon_0c^3}
\end{equation}

The energy range is also different.

Deflection parameter $K$. The difference between both types of devices is K. Normally you can vary K by increasing the space in the magnetic field (gap).

\end{equation}


\section{FCM Beamline}
\label{sec:fcm}

The four-crystal monochromator beamline operating in the PTB laboratory at BESSY II \citep{krumrey_design_1998, krumrey_high-accuracy_2001} provides a monochromatic beam in the 1.75-10 keV energy range at a fixed sample position with very high photon flux reproducibility and high energy resolving power. A schematic depiction of the bending magnet beamline and its components is shown in figure \ref{fig:FCMScheme}.

\begin{figure}%[htbp]
	\centering
		\resizebox{0.8\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{Figures/FCMScheme.png}}
		\caption{A scheme of the FCM beamline in the PTB laboratory at BESSY II. The distance of each component to the insertion device is shown.}
		\label{fig:FCMScheme}
\end{figure}

At 14 m of the insertion device, a Pt-coated toroidal mirror is located to focus the beam in the horizontal direction and to collimate it in the vertical direction. The radiation coming from the bending magnet is monochromatised further downstream by a set of 4 single crystals which reflect the light according to the Bragg's law for the (1 1 1) reflexion. As the 4 crystals are mounted on two wheels (one on the rotation center and one parallel aligned), the rotation angle of the wheel ($\Theta$) defines the energy of the outgoing photon beam by $E=\frac{\sqrt{3}h c}{2a\sin{\Theta}}$, where $a$ is the lattice constant of the crystal.

Two types of exchangeable crystal sets, Si ($a=0.543$ nm) and InSb ($a=0.648$ nm), are available to cover the energy range from 1.75 keV to 10 keV. The convolution of the 4 Bragg reflections provides a very high energy resolving power ($E/\Delta E = 10^4 $) through the full energy range. Besides, the geometric disposition of the crystals fixes the position of the outgoing radiation. The monochromator is operated under a $10^{-8}$ mbar vacuum.

The energy range is traced back to the well-known lattice constant of Si. The back-reflection of a silicon crystal at different lattice planes is measured at known energies and the energy is calibrated to the dips positions appearing when the Bragg condition is fulfilled. This approach was employed at the sensitive surface of the X-ray detector introduced in section \ref{sec:pilatus} for an energy range between 4 keV and 10 keV \citep{gollwitzer_diffraction_2014}. To check the accuracy of the energy calibration in a standard measurement, a transmission scan around the K-edge of a copper foil (8980.5 eV) can be measured.

About 10 m before the sample chamber, a bendable plane mirror collimates the beam in the vertical direction and focuses it in the horizontal direction. The mirror is coated with two different materials in separated areas. The Pt-coating is employed to maximize the reflectivity at energies above 4 keV, while the MgF$_2$ supresses the higher orders at energies below 4 keV. The photon flux achieved with the different configurations available at the FCM beamline is shown in figure \ref{fig:FCMBeamlineFlux}, although it can vary depending on the precise disposition of the different apertures along the beam path.

\begin{figure}%[htbp]
	\centering
		\input{Figures/FCMBeamlineFlux}
		\caption{Photon flux of the FCM beamline using different crystals (InSb(111) and Si(111)) and mirror coatings (MgF$_2$ and Pt) at standard operation (300 mA).}
		\label{fig:FCMBeamlineFlux}
\end{figure}

The first slit behind the bending magnet is used to limit the acceptance angle of the radiation into the monochromator. Two moveable slits more are employed downstream to block the parasitic scattering. The 8 $\mu$m thick silicon photodiode can be used for energies above 3 keV. A germanium 520 $\mu$m circular pinhole (Scatex, Incoatec, Geesthacht, Germany) situated before the sample chamber shapes the photon beam into a circular spot on the sample and strongly reduces the parasitic radiation. A flux monitor diode is equipped behind these components and can measure continuously the incoming photon flux.

\subsection{UHV X-ray Reflectometer}

The sample chamber is situated 37 m away from the insertion device, right behind the flux monitor diode. The UHV X-ray Reflectometer disposes of a large volume (60 cm diameter and 70 cm length) which is fully evacuated to reach pressures of approximately $10^{-7}$ mbar. High vacuum is needed to perform experiments at the low energies accessible at the FCM beamline, as the attenuation length of air at energies below 2 keV is less than 1 cm. A smaller lock chamber connected to the sample chamber by a small flange is used to exchange samples without breaking the vacuum of the larger UHV X-ray reflectometer.

The motors of the sample holder can be moved linearly along 3 axes perpendicular to the incoming beam and with very high precision and reproducibility. The broad range of the $x$-motor (160 mm) permits the measurement of different sample capillaries (ca. 20) at once without ventilating the chamber for exchanging the sample.

The large volume of the reflectometer provides enough space to allocate other components close to the sample holder. For example, about 10 cm before the sample position, a 1 mm circular guard pinhole (Incoatec, Geesthacht, Germany) is equipped to remove the parasitic scattering resulting from the collimating system. Behind the sample, the transmitted radiation is measured with a (10 x 10) mm$^2$ silicon photodiode. The thick Can500C diode (Canberra, Meriden, USA) is capable of measuring through the entire beamline energy range, from 1.75 keV to 10 keV, and is calibrated against a cryogenic electric substitution radiometer with a relative uncertainty of \( 1\,\% \) \cite{krumrey_high-accuracy_2001}.

\section{SAXS Setup}

The intensity scattered by the sample is recorded at a certain distance behind the sample (sample-detector distance) with an area X-ray detector mounted on the HZB SAXS instrument and connected to the sample chamber. Typically, long sample-detector distances are required to access the small angles employed in SAXS experiments.

\subsection{X-ray area detector}
\label{sec:pilatus}

The scattered X-ray photons are collected by a large-area hybrid pixel detector. The Pilatus 1M (Dectris Ltd, Baden, Switzerland) has a sensitive surface of (179 x 169) mm$^2$ and consists of a silicon pixel matrix with a pixel size of $d = (172.1 \pm 0.2)$ $\mu$m which operates in single-photon counting mode, providing very low darkcount rates and signal-to-noise ratios and a high dynamic range. For instance, the detector quantum efficiency is about 97 $\%$ at 8 keV using the ultra-high gain mode and almost 86 $\%$ at 4 keV \citep{wernecke_characterization_2014}.

Besides, the Pilatus 1M detector was modified to operate under vacuum to cover the full energetic range available at the beamline, down to 1.75 keV. The windowless detector is directly connected to the sample chamber with an evacuated bellow and cooled down at 5-10$^{\circ}$C. The narrow point-spread function of the detector and the available low energies increase the momentum transfer resolution and the accessible $q$-range.

A moveable beamstop mounted at thin wires is installed just in front of the detector to block the intense transmitted photon beam, avoiding saturation effects in the central pixels. The beamstop is constructed within a funnel-like cavity ($\oslash$ 5 mm) to reduce geometrically the reflections on the beamstop surface, which are damped by the cavity. A silicon photodiode with a sensitive area of (2.5 x 2.5) mm$^2$ (S10356-01, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) covers the beamstop to monitor the sample transmission during the experiment, revealing the possible radiation damage of the sample.

\subsection{HZB SAXS instrument and WAXS configuration}

The in-vacuum Pilatus 1M detector is mounted on the SAXS instrument of the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), which is connected via a $\oslash$100 mm flange to the UHV X-ray Reflectometer. The HZB-SAXS apparatus is equipped with a large below system and a motorized stage that can vary the sample-detector distance continuously between 2.3 m and 4.6 m in vacuum (about $10^{-4}$ mbar) with an uncertainty of 20 $\mu$m. 

Complementary to the HZB-SAXS instrument, the sample-detector distance can be reduced down to about 760 mm by attaching the X-ray detector directly to the sample chamber, increasing the scattering angles to around $8^{\circ}$. This short-distance setup, or Wide-angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) configuration, is used for the study of nanoparticles with diameters below 10 nm, whose characteristic features appear beyond 1 nm$^{-1}$. The accessible $q$-range of this setup is summarized in table \ref{tab:qrange} for the high-energy case, which provides the highest $q$-value available. Similarly, the table shows the limit $q$-values achieved with the HZB-SAXS apparatus at low-energy.

\subsubsection{Calibration of the sample-detector distance}

In small-angle scattering experiments, it is crucial to know precisely the distance between the irradiated sample and the detector, in order to calibrate the momentum transfer $q$. Typically, a calibration standard material with a well-known crystal lattice parameter is employed, which produces well-defined diffraction rings in the low-angle region. A material extensively used is dry rat-tail tendon collagen, with a $d$-spacing of 650 \AA \citep{amenitsch_performance_1997}, corresponding to $q=0.097$ nm$^{-1}$. The degradation of this material upon prolonged radiation suggested the use of harder calibrants such as silver behenate (CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{20}$COO$\cdot$Ag) \citep{huang_x-ray_1993}.

AgBehe has a very narrow diffraction ring at $q=1.0763$ nm$^{-1}$, arising from a long-period spacing ($d_{001]}$) value of 58.36 \AA \citep{blanton_jcpdsinternational_1995}, although this value depends slightly on the synthesis. A deviation of 0.5 $\%$ in the diffraction peak position could be observed for different sample preparations. In order to increase the accuracy of the calibration, the sample-detector distance was determined by the detection of the scattering pattern of AgBehe at different positions of the HZB SAXS instrument, measured with the built-in 3 m long Heidenhain optical encoder. By triangulating the radius of the diffraction ring to the source point, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}, the sample-detector distance is obtained in a traceable way.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	        \subfloat[Distance Calibration]{\resizebox{0.5\linewidth}{!}{\input{Figures/DistanceCalibrationSAXS}}\label{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}}
		\subfloat[AgBehe at large distance]{\resizebox{0.35\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{Figures/AgBeheSAXSLongDistance_edit.png}}\label{fig:AgBeheSAXSLongDistance}}

The diffraction rings exceeds the detector area. \textcolor{red}{file "messung kmc daten 2015 1Q pilatus 201501 0394.tif"}}
\end{figure}

By measuring the AgBehe pattern along a distance range of 2200 mm with 100 mm steps at 8000 eV, the relative uncertainty associated to the linear fitting is 0.03 $\%$, corresponding to 1.5 mm. As observed in the residuals of the fitting in figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}, the deviation increases for long distances, due to the relatively small $d$-spacing of AgBehe, disabling the use of distances larger than $\sim 3600$ mm. In figure \ref{fig:AgBeheSAXSLongDistance}, it is visible how the diffraction ring surpasses the surface of the detector at a distance of 3638.2 mm and, thus, diminishes the accuracy of the peak determination.

By using a material with lower $q$-value, such as the templated mesoporous silica SBA-15 \citep{zhao_triblock_1998} ($q=0.681$ nm$^{-1}$), this limitation can be mitigated as shown in figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}, where the residuals of SBA are minimal for the entire distance range. By using SBA and increasing the accessible distance range, the relative uncertainty of the fit decreases in a factor 5, reaching an uncertainty of 0.004 $\%$ (0.2 mm) when measuring with 50 mm steps. This improvement is also related with the narrower diffraction peak of SBA-15 (FWHM/$q=2.6\%$) in comparison to AgBehe ($5.5\%$).

Although the fit uncertainty is smaller in the SBA case, the position and shape of diffraction peak depend strongly on the sample preparation (e.g. template pore size). For the same polymer template, the $q$-value of the ring can vary until 1 $\%$ for different thermal treatments and radiation damage effects are visible for short calcination times. On the other side, prolonged beam exposure of AgBehe can damage the sample as well and create small silver nanoparticles, which increase the scattering background \cite{liu_thermal_2006}. The choice of the calibration standard depends strictly on the needs of the experiment. Besides, the largest contributions to the sample-detector distance uncertainty come from the thickness of the sample (ca. 0.5 mm) and from the difference between the calibration with AgBehe and SBA-15 (also 0.5 mm). Normally the uncertainty associated with the distance calibration is $10^{-4}$, similar to the energy resolving power described in section \ref{sec:fcm}.

\section{Sample environment}

The sample consists normally of a few microliters of nanoparticles in solution which are measured in a vacuum-proof container positioned inside the reflectometer. The sample environment must fulfill some requirements:

\begin{itemize}
        \item The container's material should minimize the innecessary absorption of the X-ray photon flux by the sample environment.
        \item The container volume should be small enough to enable the measurement of valuable, limited samples.
        \item The optimal sample thickness for a transmission diffraction experiment is the inverse of its attenuation coefficient $\mu(E)$, which reduces the incoming intensity to $\sim37\%$. For example, the optimal thickness of water at 8000 eV is around 1 mm.
\end{itemize}

Typically, the samples are introduced in thin glass capillaries which maintain the temperature and pressure of the sample close to the ambient conditions. However, there are different sample environments which can be used depending on the requirements of the experiment. In this work, only nanoparticles suspended in aqueous media have been employed, allowing the use of a similar attenuation coefficient for almost all experiments.

\subsection{Round capillaries}

For single-contrast SAXS measurements, borosilicate glass 3.3 round capillaries of 100 mm length were used. They were purchased at WJM Glass (Berlin, Germany) and had a nominal inner diameter of 1 mm and a wall thickness of 10 $\mu$m. The sample is filled into the capillary with a long syringe (Sterican$\textregistered$21 x 4 3/4" , Braun, Melsungen, Germany), avoiding the contact of the needle with the capillary walls. The top end of the capillary is closed by welding.

The very narrow glass walls (with a density of about 2.23 g cm$^{-3}$) absorb only 14 $\%$ of the incoming flux at 8000 eV and produce very low incoherent scattering background. Therefore, these capillaries are suitable for standard SAXS measurements. Unfortunately, the capillaries sample thickness shows a significant deviation along the vertical axis and are inappropriate for measurements at different capillary heights, as needed for the continuous contrast variation technique.

\subsection{Rectangular capillaries}

The capillaries used for the contrast variation experiments are vacuum-proof borosilicate glass capillaries from Hilgenberg (Malsfeld, Germany) with a nominal rectangular cross section of (4.2 $\pm$ 0.2) x (1.25 $\pm$ 0.05) mm$^2$ , a length of (80 $\pm$ 0.5) mm and a wall thickness of ca. 120 $\mu$m. The thicker glass walls reduce the transmitted intensity about $80\%$ at 8000 eV, but in contrast both the glass and sample thicknesses are very homogenous for the entire capillary.

\begin{figure}%[htbp]
	\centering
		\subfloat[Glass thickness]{\resizebox{0.44\linewidth}{!}{\input{Figures/HilgenbergHomogeneity}}\label{fig:HilgenbergHomogeneity}}
		\subfloat[Sample thickness]{\resizebox{0.44\linewidth}{!}{\input{Figures/WaterHomogeneity}}\label{fig:WaterHomogeneity}}
		\caption{Homogeneity of the rectangular capillaries: a) Deviation of the empty capillary tranmission, i.e. glass wall thickness, b) Sample thickness calculated from the water transmission of a filled capillary. }
\end{figure}

The transmission of an empty capillary is mapped in figure \ref{fig:HilgenbergHomogeneity}, where it can be observed that the deviation of the glass wall thickness is less than 2 $\%$ for an horizontal range of 2.5 mm (of a total width of 4.2 mm). This range is at least 5 times larger than the typical beam diameter, avoiding the convolution of different thicknesses in the measurement. Similarly, figure \ref{fig:WaterHomogeneity} depicts the sample thickness in the capillary, calculated from a capillary filled with water using the Beer-Lambert law, the glass transmission and the mass attenuation coefficient of water at 8000 eV, 10.37 cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$ \citep{hubbell_tables_1996}. The thickness of the sample introduced in the capillary is homogenous within 2 $\%$ for a width range of ca. 2.5 mm. 

\begin{figure}%[htbp]
	\centering
		\input{Figures/GaldenCalibration}
		\caption{X-ray transmission of a rectangular capillary half-filled with water along the main vertical axis situated at $x=-0.15$ mm.}
		\label{fig:GaldenCalibration}
\end{figure}

From these figures, it is clear that the homogeneity of the sample environment is even better along the main vertical axis of the capillary. Figure \ref{fig:GaldenCalibration} shows the measured X-ray transmission of a half-filled capillary along its vertical axis (at the horizontal position -0.15 mm). For example, the glass transmission within a 6 mm vertical range is $20.1\%$, with an associated relative uncertainty of $\delta_r T =0.6 \; \%$. By calculating $\delta_r d = \frac{\delta_r T}{log(T)}$ where $T$ is the glass transmission, the relative uncertainty of the glass thickness is $\delta_r d = 0.4 \; \%$. Analogously, the uncertainty of the water transmission is 0.9 $\%$ and the sample thicknes has an uncertainty of 0.9 $\%$ along the vertical axis.

These rectangular capillaries are a very suitable sample environment for measurements which require a high homogeneity along the vertical axis of the capillary. The thickness of the wall varies only 0.4 $\%$ and the sample thickness less than 0.9 $\%$, although the thick glass walls reduce considerably the transmitted intensity and produce larger background scattering than the round capillaries.

\subsection{Cell for low-energies}

Samples with larger structures require the measurement of scattering curves at lower $q$-values. To extend the measurable $q$-range, one possibility is to reduce the photon beam energy, though this involves reducing the sample thickness, due to the short penetration length of X-rays at low energies. Therefore, a custom-made sample holder is used utilizing silicon-nitride windows (NX7150E, Norcada Inc., Edmonton,Canada). The 500 nm thickness windows produce very low scattering and have a negligable absorbance ($<5\;\%$) for energies above 4000 eV.

A polymeric 100 $\mu$m ring cut with a microtome is used as spacer between the 2 windows, in order to achieve the desired 120 $\mu$m sample thickness which optimizes the intensity attenuation at 4000 eV. The acces to smaller $q$-values using this cell is shown in \cite{varga_towards_2014}, where a value of $q=0.015$ nm$^{-1}$ is achieved.

\section{Data reduction: The scattering curve}

center fitting: using a standard calibrant such as AgBehe

masking areas

finding dead pixels (disturbing pixels)

Spherical projection, i.e. normalize the intensity of the single pixels to their solid angle

Since the pixels solid angles differ, i.e. pixels in the center of the scattering pattern have a larger solid angle than those of the outer areas of the detector, a spherical projection is performed to normalize the intensity of all pixels to the same solid angle (step 7.). For this, the solid angle of each single pixel is determined.

In the first cycle, each pixel Pi is checked for being masked. If the pixel is not masked, its distance RPi to the center is calculated. Since RPi in most cases is not an integer multiple of the pixel size sp , the pixel is distributed between the next lower integer multiple Rn = nxsp < RPi and the next higher multiple Rn+1 = (n + 1) x sp > RPi


Data binning At some point in the data correction procedure for isotropically scattering samples, a data reduction step is performed, known as "integration", "averaging" or "binning". For isotropically scattering samples, a reduction in dimensionality of the data usually accompanies this procedure (e.g. from 2D images to 1D plots), by grouping and averaging pixels with similar scattering angle $q$ irrespective of their azimuthal angle on the detector (denoted $\phi$).

The advantages of this step are threefold. Firstly, the data becomes more manageable, allowing for example faster fitting and improved data visualisation. Secondly, the relative data uncertainties become smaller for the averaged data. Lastly, the standard deviation between similar pixels in a group (c.q. bin) can provide a good estimate for the actual uncertainty on the average value if this standard deviation exceeds the photon counting statistics-based estimate propagated until this step (The photon counting (Poisson) statistics defines the  absolute minimum possible uncertainty in any counting procedure. It does not consider other contributors to noise such as the variance between pixel sensitivities or electronic noise.).

for radial averaging the many datapoints Ij collected from each pixel on the the detector are reduced into a small number of q-bins Iqbin before the data analysis procedures. In this reduction step, each measured datapoint collected between the bin edges (class limits) qn and qn+1 is averaged and assumed valid for the mean:

where the summation is over all datapoints j falling within the bin edges, Nqbin the total number of datapoints in the bin. As previously mentioned and evident from equation 32, the maximum value is chosen between the propagated uncertainty and the sample standard deviation in the bin. In other words, if the sample standard deviation of the pixels in the bin exceeds the estimate based on the previously propagated uncertainty, the sample standard deviation is considered a more accurate estimate. This can be further augmented to never have a relative uncertainty estimate less than 1$\%$ of the intensity, as it is (even with the most stringent corrections) challenging to get more accurate than this [76] .

error in $3\sigma$ or $99.8\%$

There is still a choice to be made in this procedure, that is the spacing between the bin edges. Normally, this is chosen either uniform or logarithmically spaced (with more data points at low values).

the error calculation can also be used to find the scattering center




The obtained scattering curve was normalized to the exposure time, the measured suspension transmittance and the incident photon flux, measured by means of a calibrated transparent silicon diode.

\section{Small-angle X-ray scattering: DIRECT FROM PAPER}
The measurements were performed at the four-crystal monochromator beamline in the PTB laboratory at the electron storage ring BESSY II (Berlin, \emph{Germany}), which provides highly intense, collimated synchrotron radiation focused on the sample and collimated into a \(0.5\) mm circular spot by Ge pinholes situated between the sample and the monochromator with an energy resolving power \( E/\Delta E \) of \( 10^4 \). To measure the total flux and sample transmission, photodiodes were used which were calibrated against a cryogenic electric substitution radiometer with a relative uncertainty of \( 1\,\% \) \cite{krumrey_high-accuracy_2001}.

		\caption{The rectangular density gradient capillary is placed in the X-ray beam and can be moved by sample motors in both directions perpendicular to the incoming beam.}
		\label{fig:DensityGradientCapillarySetup}
\end{figure}

The rectangular capillary is placed in a sample holder which allows the movement with micrometer precision in the directions perpendicular to the incoming beam, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:DensityGradientCapillarySetup}. In order to determine the central vertical capillary axis, a horizontal X-ray transmission scan is performed at two different vertical positions of the capillary spaced by 20 mm. The central vertical axis can be drawn from the centers of both measurements and the sample can be moved along this axis by the simultaneous operation of the vertical and horizontal motors.

The sample was moved in steps of 0.5 mm along the central vertical capillary axis and exposed at each position for 45 seconds. At these positions, the solution transmittances were previously measured and the suspending medium electron density calibrated. The measured scattering curve is an average over a range of solvent electron densities associated with the beam size. The momentum transfer \(q\) of the scattering curves was calculated using
\begin{equation}
q=\frac{4\pi E}{hc}\sin\theta ,
\end{equation}
where \(\theta\) is half of the scattering angle, \(h\) is the Planck constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. The incident photon energy \(E = \left(8800.0  \pm 0.8\right)\) eV was chosen to be higher than the photon energy for the transmission measurements to improve the recorded statistics, due to a ca. \(150\) higher transmission \cite{henke_x-ray_1993}. The scattered X-ray photons were collected with a vacuum-compatible Pilatus 1M hybrid-pixel detector (Dectris Ltd, (Baden, \emph{Switzerland})) with a pixel size of \(d = \left(172.1  \pm 0.2\right) \; \mu \)m at a distance \(L = \left(4540.2  \pm 0.8\right)\) mm from the capillaries, determined by triangulation using a calibrated length measurement system \cite{wernecke_characterization_2014}. The obtained scattering curve was normalized to the exposure time and the incident intensity, measured by means of a calibrated transparent silicon diode.  In total, 40 scattering curves with different solvent electron densities were measured at two different times \(t_1=\)78 min and \(t_2=\)156 min after filling the capillaries.

\subsection{Calibration of solvent density and finding of main axis}
The transmitted intensity through the sample is recorded at a photon energy of \(E = (5500.0 \pm  0.5)\) eV for 10 seconds at each position. The measurement consists of 20 points spaced 0.5 mm along the central vertical axis of the capillary. The overall X-ray transmission measurement requires approximately 5 minutes, which is within the calculated diffusion timescale of the aqueous sucrose solution. The solvent electron density profile within the density gradient capillary derived from this measurement is depicted in figure \textcolor{red}{NO IMAGE CORRESPONDING TO THIS MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN ADDED}. A uniform thickness of the capillary within $0.5\,\%$ along this axis was determined by measuring the X-ray transmission of an empty capillary. The associated uncertainty in the sample transmission measurement is below $4\,\%$. The sample thickness is assumed to be constant. This transmission measurement is performed both immediately before and after recording the scattering patterns, which takes 15 minutes to complete. The transmittance values used for the density calibration are then linearly interpolated between both data sets taking into account the time-dependence. These values can be converted to solvent electron densities via the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the density of the solution with the transmitted intensity:
\begin{equation}
  \rho(z) = A \left( \ln{I_0} - \ln{I(z)} \right) .
\end{equation}
Here \(\rho\) is the electron density of the suspending medium, $I$ and $I_0$ are the transmitted and incoming intensities respectively and $A$ is a factor determined by the reference values of the solvent electron density at the vertical limits of the capillary at the initial time. The sucrose concentration in solution expressed as the mass fraction \( M \) at these reference points can be converted to electron densities with the empirical formula \( \rho=1.2681M+333.19 \) nm\(^{-3}\) \citep{haynes_crc_2012}. The suspending medium electron density shows a maximum uncertainty of 1 nm$^{-3}$ associated with the vertical size of the focused X-ray beam.

X-ray transmission measurements at the aqueous sucrose gradient were performed at a lower incident photon energy $E = 5500$ eV to increase the transmittance differences for the less absorbing sucrose solution by a factor of 5.
