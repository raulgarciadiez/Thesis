\section{BESSY II}

\subsubsection{Electron Accelerator}

The electron beam creates the free electrons: a hot thermionic cathode emits electrons which are accelerated with a high voltage to the anode until they reach energies up to 70 keV. The free electrons are transferred to a linear pre-accelerator which accelerates electrons to relativistic velocities up to 0.99c via an electric field. The electrons are then inserted into the microtron, which further accelerates the electrons to 50 MeV, at which point they are injected into the synchrotron. The acceleration process takes 50 ms and can be repeated with a repetition rate of 10 Hz with successive injection of electrons. Inside the synchrotron, a set of magnets are disposed in such a way as to lead the electrons in circular trajectories, whilst high frequency (HF) resonators in linear paths of the synchrotron, temporally coupled with the magnets, further accelerate the electrons to 1.72 GeV 18 .

\subsubsection{Storage ring}

The threshold energy is reached when a high electron flux with high temporal stability is achieved. At this point the electrons are injected into the storage ring, where bending magnets are implemented to maintain the circular trajectory of the electron, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:BessyScheme}. The storage ring has a circumference of 240 meters and the successive injection of electrons from the synchrotron leads to currents of approximately 290 mA in the initial stage (after injection).

\subsection{Insertion devices}

\subsubsection{Bending magent and bremsstrahlung radiation}
It is known that relativistic electrons lose kinetic energy due to the Bremsstrahlung process\citep{blumenthal_bremsstrahlung_1970} when they are accelerated or deaccelerated. This energy loss in the storage ring is compensated by high frequency resonators situated on a short linear section. In the case of a storage ring with circular shape, the electron bunches are accelerated radially (a perp v) and emit synchrotron radiation tangentially to the bunch trajectory. The power emitted


Total radiated power:
\begin{equation}
        P=\frac{e^2\gamma^4}{6\pi\epsilon_0c}\left( \dot{\beta}^2 + \frac{(\dot{\vec{\beta}} \cdot \vec{\beta})^2}{1-\beta^2} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\beta}=\frac{\vec{v}}{c}$ and $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.

If the trajectory of the electrons and the acceleration are perpendicular, for circular particle trajectories:
\begin{equation}
        P_{a \bot v}=\frac{e^2\gamma^4}{6\pi\epsilon_0c}\dot{\beta}^2=\frac{e^2\gamma^4a^2}{6\pi\epsilon_0c^3}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Other devices: Wigglers and undulators}

 High photon flux
 
The energy range is also different.

Deflection parameter $K$. The difference between both types of devices is K. Normally you can vary K by increasing the space in the magnetic field (gap).

\begin{equation}
        K=\frac{eB_0\lambda_0}{m_0 2\pi c}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Calibration of the distance}

Typically 10-4 uncertainty

Typically 30 seconds measurement at every 50 mm, forwards and backwards to increase accuracy.

Optical encoder with micrometer precision

Using AgBehe to triangulate the sample-detector distance

Before it was done only with the position of the AgBehe but we realized that the crystal lattice depended on the chemical preparation (image comparing Alfa Aesar and MTA silver benehate)

Another reference standard such as SBA (mesoporous silica, SBA-15 \cite{zhao_triblock_1998}) was used for calibration at long distances (larger periodic distance, Eike material???)

Using a distance range of 1300 mm, moving every 50 mm and with a measurement time of 15 s with an energy of 9000 eV, the AgBehe sample achieve a relative uncertainty in the distance of 0.02 $\%$. This deviations at long distances are visible in the inset of figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}.

In figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}, it can be also observed how this deviations dissappears at long distances for SBA-15. In this case, the uncertainty is 0.004 $\%$

REAL MEASUREMENT, WHOLE DISTANCE

Using a distance range of 2200 mm, moving every 100 mm and with a measurement time of 10 s with an energy of 8000 eV, the AgBehe sample achieve a relative uncertainty in the distance of 0.03 $\%$ (1.5 mm). This deviations at long distances are visible in the inset of figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}, by looking at the residuals for short distance. We just used the region for distances larger than 1000 mm.

In figure \ref{fig:DistanceCalibrationSAXS}, it can be also observed how this deviations dissappears at long distances for SBA-15. In this case, the uncertainty is 0.007 $\%$ (0.3 mm)

There is always a factor 5 between the uncertainties of SBA-15 and AgBehe. The best uncertainty achieved is with SBA and moving every 50 mm and longer exposure times (0.004 $\%$ (0.2 mm))

In figure \ref{fig:AgBeheSAXSLongDistance} we can see how AgBehe has problems at long distances. We can only use it for Pilatus Pos larger than 1000 mm.




The uncertainty of the fit (around 0.2 mm and 0.8 mm for AgBehe) is smaller than the difference between the 2 measurements (0.5 mm). Besides, the thickness of the sample is only approx in 0.5 mm. Therefore, the overal uncertainty that we can give is exactly 0.5 mm, which corresponds to 0.5 mm/4630 mm, 0.01 $\%$

The position of the peak of AgBehe is 1.0765 nm$^{-1}$ (FHWM 0.06 nm$^{-1}$, ratio is 5.5 $\%$), while the peak position of SBA is 0.681 nm$^{-1}$ (FHWM 0.018 nm$^{-1}$, ratio is 2.6 $\%$). The peak of SBA-15 obviously narrower, that is why the uncertainty is also smaller.

Good from AgBehe is that the position of the peak is always at 1.0766 nm-1 \cite{blanton_jcpdsinternational_1995} (with a crystal parameter of 58.36 angstroms, giving 1.07553 nm-1)  and varies only 0.5 $\%$. Nevertheless, by radiation it can create small silver nanoparticles which increase the background \cite{liu_thermal_2006} thermal decomposition of AgBehe.

On the other hand, SBA-15 has a narrower peak which is visible along a wider distance range and gives better statistics for the fit. However, the position of the peak is strongly dependent on the preparation (e.g. calcination time, mesopores size is tunable as explained in paper from zhao...), and can vary until 1 $\%$ (the shape also depends on the chemical preparation). Radiation damage effects are visible for short calcination times.

the uncertainty is even smaller when using the main vertical axis of the rectangular capillaries

we can see how the glass thickness (grey line) is very regular along the main axis, with a transmission of around 0.2 +- 0.01

the same for the water transmission (black line)

By fitting a line to the glass transmission, the relative error of the transmission is 0.04 $\%$. The relative uncertainty of the glass thickness is calculated by $\delta_r d = \frac{\delta_r T}{log(T)}$ and gives 0.03 $\%$

Dividing the measured transmission in water (ur 0.05$\%$) over the air transmission (ur 0.04$\%$) (Twater = 35 $\%$), we obtain the tranmission of only water and with that, the thickness of the sample. The uncertainty of the water transmission is 0.06$\%$ and the sample thicknes has an uncertainty of 0.06$\%$, by calculating $\delta_r d = \frac{\delta_r T}{log(T)}$.

Summary: When measuring along the main axis of the capillary, the glass thickness has an associated uncertainty of 0.03 $\%$ and the sample thicknes of 0.06 $\%$.

Dividing the measured transmission in water (ur 0.7$\%$) over the air transmission (ur 0.6$\%$) (Twater = 35 $\%$), we obtain the tranmission of only water and with that, the thickness of the sample. The uncertainty of the water transmission is 0.9 $\%$ and the sample thicknes has an uncertainty of 0.9$\%$, by calculating $\delta_r d = \frac{\delta_r T}{log(T)}$.

In the first setup, used to access the q-range describing the overall size of the vesicles, the sample-to-detector distance was 4.4 m and the energy of the incoming X-ray beam was set to 4 keV (wavelength 0.31 nm). Due to the short penetration length of X-rays at this energy, a custom-made sample holder was used utilizing silicon-nitride windows (NX7150E, Norcada Inc., Edmonton,Canada)

\section{Small-angle X-ray scattering: DIRECT FROM PAPER}
The measurements were performed at the four-crystal monochromator beamline in the PTB laboratory at the electron storage ring BESSY II (Berlin, \emph{Germany}), which provides highly intense, collimated synchrotron radiation focused on the sample and collimated into a \(0.5\) mm circular spot by Ge pinholes situated between the sample and the monochromator with an energy resolving power \( E/\Delta E \) of \( 10^4 \). To measure the total flux and sample transmission, photodiodes were used which were calibrated against a cryogenic electric substitution radiometer with a relative uncertainty of \( 1\,\% \) \cite{krumrey_high-accuracy_2001}.


\begin{figure}%[htbp]

		\caption{The rectangular density gradient capillary is placed in the X-ray beam and can be moved by sample motors in both directions perpendicular to the incoming beam.}
		\label{fig:DensityGradientCapillarySetup}
\end{figure}

The rectangular capillary is placed in a sample holder which allows the movement with micrometer precision in the directions perpendicular to the incoming beam, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:DensityGradientCapillarySetup}. In order to determine the central vertical capillary axis, a horizontal X-ray transmission scan is performed at two different vertical positions of the capillary spaced by 20 mm. The central vertical axis can be drawn from the centers of both measurements and the sample can be moved along this axis by the simultaneous operation of the vertical and horizontal motors.

The sample was moved in steps of 0.5 mm along the central vertical capillary axis and exposed at each position for 45 seconds. At these positions, the solution transmittances were previously measured and the suspending medium electron density calibrated. The measured scattering curve is an average over a range of solvent electron densities associated with the beam size. The momentum transfer \(q\) of the scattering curves was calculated using
\begin{equation}
q=\frac{4\pi E}{hc}\sin\theta ,
\end{equation}
where \(\theta\) is half of the scattering angle, \(h\) is the Planck constant and \(c\) is the speed of light. The incident photon energy \(E = \left(8800.0  \pm 0.8\right)\) eV was chosen to be higher than the photon energy for the transmission measurements to improve the recorded statistics, due to a ca. \(150\) higher transmission \cite{henke_x-ray_1993}. The scattered X-ray photons were collected with a vacuum-compatible Pilatus 1M hybrid-pixel detector (Dectris Ltd, (Baden, \emph{Switzerland})) with a pixel size of \(d = \left(172.1  \pm 0.2\right) \; \mu \)m at a distance \(L = \left(4540.2  \pm 0.8\right)\) mm from the capillaries, determined by triangulation using a calibrated length measurement system \cite{wernecke_characterization_2014}. The obtained scattering curve was normalized to the exposure time and the incident intensity, measured by means of a calibrated transparent silicon diode.  In total, 40 scattering curves with different solvent electron densities were measured at two different times \(t_1=\)78 min and \(t_2=\)156 min after filling the capillaries.

\subsection{Calibration of solvent density and finding of main axis}
The transmitted intensity through the sample is recorded at a photon energy of \(E = (5500.0 \pm  0.5)\) eV for 10 seconds at each position. The measurement consists of 20 points spaced 0.5 mm along the central vertical axis of the capillary. The overall X-ray transmission measurement requires approximately 5 minutes, which is within the calculated diffusion timescale of the aqueous sucrose solution. The solvent electron density profile within the density gradient capillary derived from this measurement is depicted in figure \textcolor{red}{NO IMAGE CORRESPONDING TO THIS MEASUREMENT HAS BEEN ADDED}. A uniform thickness of the capillary within $0.5\,\%$ along this axis was determined by measuring the X-ray transmission of an empty capillary. The associated uncertainty in the sample transmission measurement is below $4\,\%$. The sample thickness is assumed to be constant. This transmission measurement is performed both immediately before and after recording the scattering patterns, which takes 15 minutes to complete. The transmittance values used for the density calibration are then linearly interpolated between both data sets taking into account the time-dependence. These values can be converted to solvent electron densities via the Beer-Lambert law, which relates the density of the solution with the transmitted intensity:
\begin{equation}
  \rho(z) = A \left( \ln{I_0} - \ln{I(z)} \right) .
\end{equation}
Here \(\rho\) is the electron density of the suspending medium, $I$ and $I_0$ are the transmitted and incoming intensities respectively and $A$ is a factor determined by the reference values of the solvent electron density at the vertical limits of the capillary at the initial time. The sucrose concentration in solution expressed as the mass fraction \( M \) at these reference points can be converted to electron densities with the empirical formula \( \rho=1.2681M+333.19 \) nm\(^{-3}\) \citep{haynes_crc_2012}. The suspending medium electron density shows a maximum uncertainty of 1 nm$^{-3}$ associated with the vertical size of the focused X-ray beam.

X-ray transmission measurements at the aqueous sucrose gradient were performed at a lower incident photon energy $E = 5500$ eV to increase the transmittance differences for the less absorbing sucrose solution by a factor of 5.
